====================
Building with Podman
====================

`polycotylus` supports using Podman_ in place of Docker_ on Linux. This support
is begrudging and expensive â€“ Podman's rootless support gets very ugly when
given build tools requiring multi-user setups. Please don't use Podman with
`polycotylus` if given the choice. Support is intended only for RedHat/RPM based
Linux distributions where Podman is favoured so strongly that Docker is removed
from the official package repositories.

To switch between Docker_ and Podman_, use ``polycotylus --configure``::

    # Instruct polycotylus to use podman as its docker implementation
    polycotylus --configure docker=podman

    # Instruct polycotylus to use a specific podman location
    polycotylus --configure docker=/usr/bin/podman

    # Restore the default of using docker
    polycotylus --configure docker=

Caveats
.......

* On most host setups, using Qemu architecture emulation leads to an issue with
  sudo. ::

      sudo: effective uid is not 0, is /usr/bin/sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid' option set or an NFS file system without root privileges?

  An explanation and fix can be found in `here
  <https://stackoverflow.com/a/77354286>`_.

* When building for Fedora, you may run into errors in rootless mode like::

      sudo: PAM account management error: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info
      sudo: a password is required

  I have no idea what prompts these or how to fix them.

* Build times are roughly double what they are with Docker_.

* Expect a degree of sourness from me if you ever need to report a
  Podman-specific issue.
