Building for Debian Linux
=========================

Basic usage::

    polycotylus debian

* Supported architectures: ``amd64 arm64 armel armhf i386 mips64el ppc64el riscv64 s390x``

* Debian packages will be compatible with the following distributions **only**
  when they migrate to a Debian >= 13 base: `Raspbian
  <https://www.raspbian.org/>`_ (use ``--architecture=armhf``), `Kali Linux
  <https://www.kali.org/>`_, `deepin <https://www.deepin.org/>`_, `Cumulus Linux
  <https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux/>`_,
  `SteamOS <https://store.steampowered.com/steamos>`_

* Debian packages are similar to but incompatible with: `Parrot OS
  <https://parrotlinux.org/>`_, `Ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com>`_, `Devuan
  <https://www.devuan.org/>`_

As with Alpine, don't just blindly build for every architecture. ``mips``
devices are almost exclusively found in electric gates and Wi-Fi routers â€“ not
something for a desktop application. Debian uses some nonstandard/brand names
for its architectures. The following table maps Debian names to what each
architecture is normally called.

===========  ====================
Debian name  Instruction set name
===========  ====================
``amd64``    ``x86_64``
``arm64``    ``aarch64``
``armel``    ``armv5l``
``armhf``    ``armv7l``
``ppc64el``  ``ppc64le``
===========  ====================


Caveats
.......

* Due to Debian's extremely slow release cycle, only the testing branch of
  Debian (13 a.k.a. Trixie) or can be supported.
