Building for Arch Linux
=======================

Basic (and only) usage::

    polycotylus arch

* Supported architectures: ``x86_64``

* Arch packages are compatible with: `EndeavourOS <https://endeavouros.com/>`_,
  `Garuda Linux <https://garudalinux.org/>`_, `ArcoLinux
  <https://arcolinux.com/>`_, `BlackArch Linux <https://www.blackarch.org/>`_,
  `Archcraft <https://archcraft.io/>`_, `Athena OS <https://athenaos.org/>`_

* Arch packages are similar to but incompatible with: `Manjaro Linux
  <https://manjaro.org/>`_, `Artix Linux <https://artixlinux.org/>`_


Lifetime of a build
...................

Arch Linux is a rolling build meaning that new versions of packages containing
ABI incompatibilities (or any other incompatibilities arising from the build and
runtime environments being different) can be released at any time and pinning or
downgrading dependencies is prohibited â€“ your only option is to rebuild and
re-release. One prominent case of this is the annual increment of the Arch
repositories' Python's minor version. When this happens, the ``site-packages``
directory (e.g. ``/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/``) moves so that your
package is no longer findable. Once this happens, your existing built packages
are effectively useless and you need to rebuild and release then encourage your
users to run ``pacman -Syu`` (upgrade all packages) before installing/upgrading
your package in case they still have the previous version of Python installed.


Package Signing
...............

Arch packages are optionally signed using a GnuPG_ detached signature. See
:ref:`gpg_signing` for the signing itself.

**To consume** your signed package, downstream users will need to install your
public key into their ``pacman`` key stores. You can get your key to them in two
ways:

1. The recommended way is to upload it to Arch's preferred keyserver::

    gpg --armor --export 3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9
    # Copy/paste the output to http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/#submitKey

  Note that there will be around a one hour propagation delay before the next
  steps can work. Installers of your package should be instructed to import your
  key from the keyserver as follows::

    sudo pacman-key --init
    sudo pacman-key --recv-keys 3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9
    sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9

2. Alternatively, you can boycott the keyserver and put the public key somewhere
   on your website. Run::

    gpg --armor --export 3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9 > 3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9.asc

  Then put the ``.asc`` file somewhere downloadable on your website, with
  instructions to your users to run::

    sudo pacman-key --init
    curl https://your.website/downloads/3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9.asc | sudo pacman-key --add -
    sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3CB69E1833270B714034B7558CA85BF8D96DB4E9
